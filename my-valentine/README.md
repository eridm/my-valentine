Will you be my Valentine please :)

---

**Description:**

This website is a fun little experiment to ask someone to be your Valentine, inspired by the "will you be my Valentine please :)" code from [dev-smurf](https://github.com/dev-smurf). The idea is simple: create an engaging interface where the person you're asking can't say no.
(Note: this is for funsies only! consent is always the key to get the date of your dreams!!)

**Features:**

1. **Simple Question:**
   - The site asks a straightforward question to the user: "Be my valentine, pwease?"

2. **Limited Response Options:**
   - Response options are limited to "Yes" or "No". although the "it's a no" button will start to move around when the user hovers the cursor on it. They can't say no when they can't click the 'no button', right? *wink wink

**Technologies Used:**
